# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This project was created to learn the prerequisites of the Front-End Developer boocamp that include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Github
- I built this project to see how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together, in preparation to the bootcamp
- It helped me get a grasp of the basics of these three languages and create a basic index page that has content, style and interactivity
- I learned about functions and variables in JavaScript as I already had some notions of HTML and CSS.
